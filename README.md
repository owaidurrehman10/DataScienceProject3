# Project on Machine Learning Model building 
# To predict the house price against the given independent variables
- Data Cleaning-> The data was cleaned by removing the outliers using the standard derivation approach and 
                  The categorical data was converted to numerical values
  
- Data Analysis &  Data visualization->Data Analysis was done using the matplotlib library and seaborn library of python where the correlation was studied creating subplots and to check the median and any outliers present, the box plot was used

 

Model Building->  Using Algorithm of:
                  GradientBoostingRegressor & Random Forest

Model Testing-> To enhance the performance of the model, the various techniques were used like:
# GridSearchCv
# Features Importance: To find and remove the Low importance features: ['bedrooms', 'mainroad', 'guestroom', 'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'prefarea', 'furnishingstatusâ€™] 
# R2_Score metrics was used to test the performance of the model
